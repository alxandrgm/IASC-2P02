        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>The people in the cave for the longest time have just seen what they described as a giant on the cave wall. This giant has been unmoving for what they believe have been years now, a warden of sorts for the people in the cave.
           These people have been all alone for so long that they have no concept of the outside world. They believe the thing on the wall has a big body and a big head, much larger than their own.   
           All of a sudden, <span class = "clickable" id = "first-change">the giant began to appear and disappear.</span>
           The people in the cave were in awe. They had no idea where the giant was going or what lies beyond the cave walls. They thought that because the giant has been gone for so long that it may have died. Their whole world is contained within those four corners, and anything beyond that must not exist. 
           The giant may have ceased to exist in their eyes. But after what felt like days to them, the giant returned. And with this, brought even more confusion to them. 
           How was the giant able to return if there was nothing beyond the cave walls? How could there be a world beyond the four corners if all they knew was right in front of them?  
        </p>

        <p>Nick Sousanis’s concept of Flatness means that people or anything in general will not understand things that they are not used to. 
            They only know what they can see for themselves and what was taught to them. 
            Anything more is something beyond their comprehension or does not exist to them. 
            To me, Flatness means a perspective that is narrow, with no understanding of how things really work. Looking at the last couple of pages of this section, it could also be a metaphor for how we oftentimes feel stuck in the world seen from our perspective. With a new change in perspective, the world opens up again.  
            And then, <span class = "clickable" id = "second-change">parts of the giant, such as the head or body, began to be engulfed by the cave floor and ceiling. </span>
            To the people in the cave, they have only known the giant to be still. When they saw the giant move for the first time and then disappear from the cave walls, they thought it would never come back. 
            To them, nothing beyond the walls exists, they cannot imagine what there is. When the giant came back, it shocked the people. 
            Even now, the giant is moving in directions where the people simply cannot comprehend. 
            When the giant’s body disappears but the head is still there, they are surprised that the giant is even alive. When the whole body comes back, they wonder where it went.

        <h2>2. Seeing Doubles</h2>

        <p>The “giant” that appears for the people in the cave is just a normal sized person. The person has a large, red coat, giving them the appearance of a larger body. 
           The person is also jumping up and down from a hole. Behind the person, there is the sun which shines brightly against the cave wall. 
           To the people outside the cave wall, they have seen the person moving back and forth completing some of their tasks beyond both sides of the cave walls and then begin to exercise by jumping up and down a hole in the center of the cave wall. 
           And then, through the perspective of the people inside the cave, <span class = "clickable" id = "third-change">the giant's body began to contort itself, shrinking and growing as the giant moved up and down. </span>
           In reality, the person was simply spinning around while still jumping. The people in the cave have not seen people moving in different directions let alone different dimensions so it confuses them even more when the giant is suddenly changing in size while still having parts of its body disappearing. 
           They do not understand what is happening outside the cave walls and now it’s terrifying them. The person spinning around is having fun while exercising. 
           They do not realize that they are causing the people in the wall to have their whole world change in the blink of an eye. 
        </p>

        <p2>Nick Sousanis’s Concept of Seeing Doubles means by looking at things from more than one perspective, which helps with understanding the full concept of something. It is not possible to grasp the full story of something when you view only through your own lenses. 
           I think we grow as people by taking the experiences of other people to build our own truths. If we only saw things in one perspective, we would not be able to fully realize ourselves and our potential as emotional, capable beings.
           We would have no empathy or growth, only knowing the things we have seen or done and never learning about the different things and ways other people may have experienced life. The people in the cave have never seen the outside world; they only know about what lies in front of them. 
           They have only seen the flatness of the cave walls and have never seen anything beyond them, so they cannot understand what is happening beyond the cave. The people outside the cave have seen the outside world, they know how things really work but they cannot understand what is happening inside the cave itself. To them, they can only see the little opening where the sun is shining thorugh and where the person is standing. 
           <span class = "clickable" id = "fourth-change">The sun began to set behind the giant,</span> 
           perplexing the people in the cave even further.
           To the people in the cave, the giant was engulfed fully by whatever lies beyond the cave wall. The people outside the cave have seen the sun set before meaning that they know shadows no longer show. 
           By combining both perspectives, the reason why the people in the cave thought the person was a giant was due to the person standing right behind the sun which meant that they would cast a larger shadow towards the cave wall. 
           And the people outside of the cave would understand that if you were to only see one thing for your whole life, you would think that would be the only thing that exists in your life. 
           Seeing both perspectives, you could understand that someone that would stand in front of a light source would appear larger, moving away from the direct light will cause your shadow to disappear from the surface, and when the sun sets, there is no light source that will cast shadows. 
           Each person's perspective plays a part in the whole which in this scenario makes up the full truth of the situation.
